[General]
; Enable the wrapper (false = pure pass-through, no interception)
Enabled=true

; Log level: 0=none, 1=error, 2=warn, 3=info, 4=debug
LogLevel=3

[FFB]
; Global FFB enable/disable (false = block FFB on ALL devices)
Enabled=true

; Log all FFB operations (effect create/start/stop/params, commands)
LogEffects=true

; Default FFB force scale for all devices (0-100, 100 = full force)
DefaultScale=100

; Automatically restart FFB effects after device reconnection.
; When enabled, the wrapper remembers which effects were running and
; auto-starts them when DCS recreates them after a reconnect.
AutoRestart=true

[FFBDevices]
; Per-device FFB policy.
; Format: DeviceNameSubstring=action
;
; Actions:
;   block   - completely disable FFB for matching devices
;   allow   - explicitly allow FFB (useful with global FFB disabled)
;   0-100   - scale FFB force to this percentage (0 = effectively block)
;
; Matching is case-insensitive substring against the device product name.
; First matching rule wins. Devices with no matching rule use the global
; FFB enabled state and DefaultScale.
;
vJoy=block          ; Block all FFB for any device with "vJoy" in the name
Pedals=block        ; Block FFB for any device with "Pedals" in the name
Collective=block    ; Block collective FFB for helicopters
; MSFFB 2=50        ; Example: scale to 50%
; Example: scale a specific stick to 50% force
; MSFFB 2=50
